This directory contains two shell scripts. You will have to
decide on where you want to put these in your system. This may
involve small changes to these scripts and to the makefile in
../p1 to ../p5 and ../evaluator. Note lucomp and luval are the
names used in the UNIX manual entry. (see ../manual/lucid.1 )

   I)  lucid <filename>   used to compile and run lucid
       programmes.

  II)  lucomp (filename> used to compile lucid programmes.


 Note luval is not a shell script it is simple the a.out file
      associated with pass6. (see makefile in ../evaluator )
